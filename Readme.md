# FSEP 100 Portfolio Page

This is a solution to the Portfolio Page assignment fot the FSEP program

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to write semantic HTML and CSS as well as use Flexbox. I liked the idea of adding the language logos to add come colors to the page. The cards were difficult to create as were the media queries so I chose to make them smaller which affected the iage quality but did help with responsiveness. If I had extra time, I would work on improving image quality.
